This book exists because Flutter was released and such a revolutionary technology needed a way for people to know about it and learn it however they prefer. So, before even talking about the book, it’s necessary to remember how good it is for the developer community that Google has released Flutter and they’re continuing to invest in it to make it even more revolutionary and important every day that passes.

Talking about the book, it has to be said that working with the Pragmatic Bookshelf has been great. First of all, I want to thank Andy Hunt, who as a publisher has built a wonderful team: starting from my very first interactions with Brian MacDonald over my proposal to write this book everyone has been thorough, welcoming, and helpful.
</p>

  <p id="d24e123">
In particular, I want to thank Michael Swaine who, as the editor of this book, has been encouraging, helpful, and understanding throughout the process, never making me feel pressured and always helping and encouraging me when any issues arose or when I had questions about anything related to the book.
</p>

When bigger and more technical issues arose, production manager Janet Furlow has fixed them, allowing me to keep working on the content of the book instead. The cover Gilson Graphics made for the book is very nice as a visual metaphor of Flutter’s multi-platform nature. In addition to those I have mentioned, I want to thank everyone else at the Pragmatic Bookshelf who has been involved in making the book as good as it is.
</p>

  <p id="d24e130">
I want to thank everybody who has looked at the book and given me feedback, which I have taken on and tried to use to the best of my ability to make the book better for everyone. In particular, the technical reviewers who have been thorough and thoughtful in their feedback and the beta book readers who have taken their time to submit errata: it’s been very important and seeing how thorough they have been has encouraged me to do as much as I could for the book. Thank you Giordano Scalzo, Alessio Salvadorini, Erdem Orman, Paul Freiberger, and John Barry.
</p>

  <p id="d24e132">
I want to thank everyone I know informally: my friends and family have all been very encouraging and supportive and have made this journey more pleasant than it could have ever been without their support. Knowing the people close to me were happy with the fact that I was doing this was invaluable. I would also like to mention the people who were less close to me, who knew me barely or not at all previously and who have reached out to ask about the book because they made the results of my work feel like something closer to me.
