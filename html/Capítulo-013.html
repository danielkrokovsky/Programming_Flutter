        Getting Started with Flutter
      </h1>

  <blockquote class="partintro" id="d24e1287">

    <p id="d24e1288">
          Even though Flutter is very easy to pick up, we need to actually know
          what it can do for us and how it’s done.
        </p>

    <p id="d24e1290">
          That’s what the chapters in this part are about: you’ll write your first app and in the process learn what Flutter
          widgets are and how they can be used to create user interfaces.
        </p>

    <p id="d24e1292">
          After that, you’ll start combining more and more Flutter widgets together,
          and, at the end of Part I, you’ll learn how to use Dart packages
          to get Google-developed and third-party libraries to build more
          apps that use features not present in Flutter’s (or Dart’s) standard
          library.
        </p>

    <p id="d24e1294">
          You’ll also learn how to run methods written in native Swift/Objective-C
          and Kotlin/Java to interact with low-level features that would otherwise
          be inacessible in Flutter.
        </p>
