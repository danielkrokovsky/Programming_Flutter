  <h2 id="d24e12065">Why a GridView Wouldnâ€™t Work</h2>

  <p id="d24e12068">
<span class="cf class">GridView</span>s are meant for something completely different: building scrollable, probably variable grids that usually have more widgets than could be displayed comfortably in a non-scrollable grid.</p>

  <p id="d24e12077">What we are doing here is simply displaying a small, fixed amount of I/O widgets in both the vertical and horizontal axis, which you should do using nested <span class="cf class">Row</span>s and <span class="cf class">Column</span>s.</p>
