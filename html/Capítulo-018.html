  <p id="d24e4666">We have built a simple Flutter app starting from an example. Now it’s time to start writing apps from scratch so that you’ll be able to build any kind of app a client or employer might request of you. In this chapter you will learn about the different Flutter layout and content widgets, and how to add your own custom assets to Flutter apps.</p>
