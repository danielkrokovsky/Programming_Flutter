      <h3>Fixing Your Scrum</h3>

      <div class="cover-image"><a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rrscrum"><img alt="" src="images/_covers/Imagem-79.jpg"/></a></div>

      <p>
      Broken Scrum practices limit your organization’s ability to take full advantage of the agility Scrum should bring: The development team isn’t cross-functional or self-organizing, the product owner doesn’t get value for their investment, and stakeholders and customers are left wondering when something—anything—will get delivered. Learn how experienced Scrum masters balance the demands of these three levels of servant leadership, while removing organizational impediments and helping Scrum teams deliver real-world value. Discover how to visualize your work, resolve impediments, and empower your teams to self-organize and deliver using advanced coaching and facilitation techniques that honor and support the Scrum values and agile principles.

      <h3>Software Estimation Without Guessing</h3>

      <div class="cover-image"><a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/gdestimate"><img alt="" src="images/_covers/Imagem-43.jpg"/></a></div>

      <p>
      Developers hate estimation, and most managers fear disappointment with the results, but there is hope for both. You’ll have to give up some widely held misconceptions: let go of the notion that “an estimate is an estimate,” and estimate for your particular need. Realize that estimates have a limited shelf-life, and re-estimate frequently as needed. When reality differs from your estimate, don’t lament; mine that disappointment for the gold that can be the longer-term jackpot. We’ll show you how.

      <p>
      You work in a loop: write code, get feedback, iterate. The faster you get feedback, the faster you can learn and become a more effective developer. Test-Driven React helps you refine your React workflow to give you the feedback you need as quickly as possible. Write strong tests and run them continuously as you work, split complex code up into manageable pieces, and stay focused on what’s important by automating away mundane, trivial tasks. Adopt these techniques and you’ll be able to avoid productivity traps and start building React components at a stunning pace!
