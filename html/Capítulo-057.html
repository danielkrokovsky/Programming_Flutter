  <p id="d24e19810">Writing apps that are isolated to the user’s own phone is fine for some applications, but a great majority of apps need to interact with a web API or back end, which is what we’ll be doing in this chapter.</p>

  <p id="d24e19812">Flutter’s standard library doesn’t include a standard networking component: even though you can actually use the network to fetch images, you can’t make standard HTTP requests using just the Flutter/Dart standard library.</p>

  <p id="d24e19814">This is the reason why we are going to talk about it now: Flutter has a Google-developed package on Pub called <span class="emph">http</span>, which allows us to make HTTP requests and connect our app to a Web API.</p>
