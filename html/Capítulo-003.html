           Our ebooks do not contain any Digital Restrictions
           Management, and have always been DRM-free. We pioneered the
           beta book concept, where you can purchase and read a book
           while it’s still being written, and provide feedback to the
           author to help make a better book for everyone. Free
           resources for all purchasers include source code downloads
           (if applicable), errata and discussion forums, all
           available on the book's home page at pragprog.com. We’re
           here to make your life easier.
