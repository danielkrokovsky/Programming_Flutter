            Appendix
            1</span><br/><span class="chapter-name"> Introduction to Dart </span></h1>

  <p id="d24e41681">Dart is a new language, and you might not be aware of its syntax and some of its features. Here I’ll provide an overview of Dart so that you can have a better grasp on how it works.</p>

  <p id="d24e41683">Dart, in many ways, resembles C, C++, and Java, so developers with good knowledge of those languages shouldn’t have too many issues understanding the code in the book, but there are also differences that I’ll point out along the way.</p>

  <p id="d24e41685">This appendix is also a good starting point for people who don’t have much programming experience.</p>
